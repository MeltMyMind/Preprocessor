Tool to preprocess datasets

This is a nice little tool to help anybody with preprocessing csv files for machine learning. I'm still working on it, but it can be used already nonetheless. 

A more detailed description will follow shortly. 

To install all the necessary dependencies, use the requirements.txt files like this: 
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Description:

**Import dataset:**

Currently only csv's are supported. Other file types will be implemented shortly. 

Type in the name of the dataset in the directory you want to import (ex: mydataset.csv). If you want to change the directory, please click on the button Change Dir.
