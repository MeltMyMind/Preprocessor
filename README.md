# PreProHelper
Tool to preprocess datasets

This is a nice little tool to help anybody with preprocessing csv files for machine learning. I'm still working on it, but it can be used already nonetheless. 

A more detailed description will follow shortly. 

## Setup:

**Running the file:**
The setup is fairly simple, since it is only one python file "PreproHelper.py" which one needs to run. After running the file, a new window will open, which the user can then use to preprocess his/her dataset. 

The file can either be run directly in any IDE such as Pycharm or Visualstudio or it can be run through the terminal/command line by cd'ing to the corresponding directory and then running the file (ex. python PreproHelper.py). 

**Installing packages/dependencies:**
The file needs a few packages in order to run. They are all listed in the *requirements.txt* file
To install all the necessary dependencies, use pip in the terminal/command line like this by first cd'ing to the directory where you put *requirements.txt* and the running: 

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Description:

**Import dataset:**

Currently only csv's are supported. Other file types will be implemented shortly. 

Type in the name of the dataset in the directory you want to import (ex: mydataset.csv). If you want to change the directory, please click on the button Change Dir.
