# Preprocessor
Tool to preprocess datasets

This is a nice little tool to help anybody with preprocessing csv files for machine learning. I'm still working on it, but it can be used already nonetheless. 

A more detailed description will follow shortly. 

To install all the necessary dependencies, use the requirements.txt files like this: 
pip install -r requirements.txt
